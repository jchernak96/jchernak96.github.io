Sports Info Solutions (SIS) posed the following prompt as a part of their 2021 analytics competition: Which route combinations were most popular in the NFL in 2020? Of these route combinations, which perform best against each coverage type?

This was a fun question to answer (and for a great cause)! I was a finalist in the competition and my submission can be watched on Youtube or read below.
