Recently I have been reading Statistical Rethinking along with Introduction to Empirical Bayes: Examples from Baseball Statistics. Both discuss Bayesian techniques in R, the latter discussing Bayes in the context of baseball and batting averages. This got me thinking of binary outcomes that I could measure in football and how to apply some of the techniques outlined by the author. One topic that quickly came to mind was completion percentage in college football (as CFB doesn't have CPOE data I figured this would be more applicable than NFL). In this post, I establish a framework for evaluating CFB QB completion percentage with bayes and informative priors that take advantage of recruit ranks.

## Data & Cleaning

I used the CFB Fast R API to obtain CFB QB data from 2014 to 2020. In addition, I loaded in CFB recruiting class data from the CFB Data API for the years 2000 to 2020. Not all of these years are needed but I wanted to ensure that any QB who played in our play by play dataset was captured by the recruiting data. I then filtered for dual threat and pro players (both QBs) and merged recruit info with pbp data. Below is a code snippet of the data call, full cleaning can be found in my GitHub but it primarily involves joining the data and making sure there are no issues.

```{r}
pbp <- data.frame() #blank frame
#Loop
for (x in 2014:2020) {
  progressr::with_progress({
  future::plan("multisession")
  qb_perf <- cfbfastR::load_cfb_pbp(x)
  qb_perf <- qb_perf %>%
  filter(pass == 1) %>%
  dplyr::select(passer_player_name,
         year,
         week,
         pos_team,
         def_pos_team,
         EPA, 
         pass,
         game_id,
         id_play,
         game_play_number, 
         completion,
         pass_attempt)
  pbp <- rbind(pbp, qb_perf)
  
  })
}
qb_ratings <- data.frame() #blank data frame for merging
for (x in 2000:2020) {
  PRO  <- cfbd_recruiting_player(x, position = "PRO")
  DUAL <- cfbd_recruiting_player(x, position = "DUAL")
  qb_ratings <- rbind(qb_ratings, PRO, DUAL)
}
```
## Exploring Predictors of QB Completion Percentage

### Recruiting Rankings

When evaluating CFB QB's, we always have access to some prior information regarding their ability. This can be actual in game performance or it can be their prestige, aka their recruiting rating. There are a few different metrics by which CFB players are graded (stars, composite ranking, overall class rank) that we can use to give our model some guidance on what to expect from a QB. For context, one important aspect of Bayesian analysis is priors and how they can guide a model in the absence of much data. A prior essentially says that given player x's recruiting ranking, what are the range of outcomes related to a variable of interest (in our case completion percentage). This is a very valuable tool for determining the possible outcomes for a QB who we don't have much information on (such as a freshman or redshirt). Back to CFB recruit grades, we first must determine which of the mentioned variables are most predictive of a CFB QB's completion percentage. Below, I evaluate the correlation between each metric and career completion percentage. 

All metrics are close to each other in terms of correlation. Thus, I chose to use the composite rating (0-100 scale) because of the added layer of granularity relative to stars. We can visualize the relationship between composite rating and CP% with a smoothing spline below.
