Sports Info Solutions (SIS) posed the following prompt as a part of their 2021 analytics competition: Which route combinations were most popular in the NFL in 2020? Of these route combinations, which perform best against each coverage type?

This was a fun question to answer (and for a great cause)! I was a finalist in the competition and my submission can be watched on Youtube or read below. The judging committee consisted of multiple analytics professionals (both in the NFL and in the media) along with a former college football coach.
